Price updater for e-commerce shop using NBP API

The seller has an e-commerce store with various products. Until now, trade was carried out in Poland. The seller would like to ship goods to European Union countries and the United States. Therefore, there was a need for him to accept payments in American dollars (USD) and in Euro. The buyer needs to know how much the goods cost in a given currency. The seller needs a solution that will periodically download the current exchange rate from the National Bank of Poland once a day or on request and update the prices for products in the database.
